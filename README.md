## Lingua - Live your transcription dreams

- This is a Chrome extension that helps you translate text from any website into another language.
- To use the extension, you simply highlight the text you want to translate, click the extension in the toolbar, and then click the "Transcribe" button in the extension popup.
- The extension will then send the selected text to OpenAI's API, where it will be translated into the target language.
- The API response will be displayed in the extension popup, showing both the original text and the IPA transcription.
- The user can select the target language for the transcription from the dropdown menu in the popup.
- The API key is saved using Chrome's storage API, so the user only has to enter it once.
- The extension logs the original text and API response to the console for debugging purposes.
- If the user hasn't added their API key to the extension options, they will be prompted to do so.
